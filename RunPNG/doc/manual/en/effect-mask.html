				<p>Mask</p>

				<p>As already mentioned at another place in this manual, the mask effect is somewhat similar to the layer mask in a graphics editor.
				This is a masking of the graphic with a greyscale image. Whereby the color white means full representation and black means complete
				transparency. The nuances in between let the graphics shine through more or less.</p>
				
				<p>The subject of the mask application should be the APNG file <b>RunPNG/doc/samples/various/throbber 256x256.png</b>. We load it
				into RunPNG (it consists of 80 individual images). Then we select the <b>Mask</b> effect under the <b>Effects</b> tab.</p>

				<p>Unlike the picture boxes for the other effects, the box for the mask effect does not have a transparent background, but a white one.
				Transparencies are not possible here. In addition, there is no color picker. Just a slider with which you can increase or decrease the
				opacity. The term opacity here refers to the loaded graphic itself. If the <b>Opacity</b> slider is moved to 0%, the background in the
				box is black and the graphic is invisible. At 50% there is a visible graphic, but it is very translucent.</p>
				
				<p>This would already explain the purpose of the full-surface mask. And why the area in the image box is white by default. A change
				directly affects the loaded pictures and makes them translucent. Which enables interesting effects on a website against a corresponding
				background. But let's set the opacity slider back to 100% and take a short excursion to the <b>Foreground</b> effect.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effect-mask-foreground.png" width="340"/>
				
				<p>In the <b>Foreground</b> effect, we load the file <b>RunPNG/doc/samples/various/Sprocket 3.png</b> into the image box and return to
				the mask effect. Now the animation can let off steam behind the gear. But when you start the player, the animation breaks out to the
				left and right of the gear.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effect-mask-run.png" width="768"/>
				
				<p>But we don't want that. We want to limit the representation of the animation to the hole in the middle of the gear. So we stop the
				player and load the mask <b>RunPNG/doc/samples/various/Mask 3.png</b> into the picture box of the <b>Mask</b> effect. </p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effect-mask-loaded.png" width="768"/>
				
				<p>And that's the end of the breakout. The image for the mask of course follows the same rules as the setting with the <b>Opacity</b>
				slider. White is full opacity, black is full transparency. Whereby it doesn't have to be limited to gaudy black and white. There are
				also gradients with grayscale possible. In this way, interesting animations can be punched out.</p>
				
				<p><b>Note:</b> When using a full mask image, the slider no longer has any effect. Unless the mask image has transparent areas.
				Just an idea. </p>
