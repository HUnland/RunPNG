				<p>In addition to animation, RunPNG offers a few useful effects. These will be permanently connected to the finished image, because the
				generally applicable PNG format does not have such effect additives. Ok, one could define own data blocks for something like this, but
				then no other software except RunPNG would understand them.</p>

				<p>The effects can be found under the tab of the same name in the sidebar.</p> 

				<p class="contentsubtitle">Effect Selection</p>
				
				<p>
					<img class="hcenter" src="images/runpng-effects.png" width="340"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>There are currently four options available in the selection list. </p>
				
				<p><b>Mask:</b> Who is familiar with graphics programs may also know the functionality of the layer mask. This is a masking of
				the graphic with a greyscale image. Whereby the color white means full representation and black means complete transparency. The nuances
				in between make the graphic look more or less translucent.</p>
				
				<p><b>Background:</b> The background can be a simple color, a loaded image, or both. As the name suggests, the background is behind
				the graphic or image sequence.</p>
				
				<p><b>Foreground:</b> The foreground can also be a simple color, a loaded image, or both. The foreground is in front of the graphic.
				So the simple color should be at least translucent. Otherwise you would not see anything of the animated image sequence. The situation
				is similar with an additional image that should also have transparencies.</p>
				
				<p><b>Flux Generator:</b> Strictly speaking, this is not really an effect that is applied to a sequence of images. The Flux Generator
				creates a new image sequence based on an image that has been loaded. This means that any previously loaded image sequence would be
				overwritten when the Flux Generator was used.</p>
				
				<p>The effects mentioned can of course also be used together.</p>
				
				<p class="contentsubtitle">Picture Box</p>
				
				<p>The individual effects are described on their own pages. This is about the picture box element, which is represented on all effect pages.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effects-picbox0.png" width="340"/>
				
				<p>A single image is loaded into the picture box by clicking the <img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-folder.png" /> - button.
				And it can be removed using the <img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-trashbin.png" /> - button.</p>
				
				<p>There are five buttons on the left side of the picture box. These buttons are used to scale a loaded image for the purpose of adaptation.
				However, scaling is only possible and useful if the loaded image has other dimensions than those with which the application is working.
				If a dimension - width or height - is larger, it can be compressed. If it is smaller, it can be stretched. Let's take the following ellipse
				as an example. The picture can be found under <b>RunPNG/doc/samples/various/green-ellipse.png.</b>.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effects-picbox1.png" width="400"/>
				
				<p>According to the tooltip, the ellipse has 126 x 96 pixels, while the application in this case is set to 256 x 256 pixels. So there is
				potential for growth in both directions. No zoom level has been selected at this moment. The individual scaling levels look as follows.</p> 
				
				<table>
				<tr valign="top">
				<td><img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-scale-sym.png" /></td>
				<td><b>Symmetrical scaling:</b> The image will be scaled while preserving the aspect ratio.</td>
				<td><img src="../images/effects-picbox-sym.png" width="150"/><td>
				</tr>  
				<tr valign="top">
				<td><img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-scale-asym.png" /></td>
				<td><b>Asymmetrical scaling:</b> The image will be scaled to the relative width and height of the application.</td>
				<td><img src="../images/effects-picbox-asym.png" width="150"/><td>
				</tr>  
				<tr valign="top">
				<td><img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-scale-horz.png" /></td>
				<td><b>Horizontal scaling:</b> The image will be scaled to the relative width of the application. The height remains unchanged.</td>
				<td><img src="../images/effects-picbox-horz.png" width="150"/><td>
				</tr>  
				<tr valign="top">
				<td><img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-scale-vert.png" /></td>
				<td><b>Vertical scaling:</b> The image will be scaled to the relative height of the application. The width remains unchanged.</td>
				<td><img src="../images/effects-picbox-vert.png" width="150"/><td>
				</tr>
				<tr valign="top">
				<td><img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-scale-reset.png" /></td>
				<td><b>Reset scaling:</b> The image will be reset to its own dimensions relative to the size of the application.</td>
				<td><img src="../images/effects-picbox-reset.png" width="150"/><td>
				</tr>
				</table>

				<p class="contentsubtitle">Skip First Picture</p>
				
				<p>The effects such as mask, background and foreground have an option button below the image box for skipping the first image.
				This is intended to don't apply the effect in the case of the mode <b>Animated, skip first frame</b>. It is at the discretion
				of the user to use this. In the case of the <b>Animated</b> or <b>Not animated</b> modes, however, it wouldn't make much sense
				to use this option.</p>
