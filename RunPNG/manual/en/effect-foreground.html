				<p>A foreground color should be translucent to transparent so that you can see something of the actual graphic. The same applies to the
				foreground image. To try out this effect, we first load an animated beach ball into the working memory. The image is located at
				<b>RunPNG/doc/samples/various/Beach ball 256x256.png</b>. It is an APNG file and consists of 20 individual images.
				We don't need to change any setting. Or we continue to use the picture from the Background section, as shown here.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effect-foreground-color.png" width="340"/>
				
				<p>The <b>Foreground</b> effect can be found under the <b>Effects</b> tab. Let's start with the Foreground color. To do this, click on
				the color selector and choose any color. E.g. black. And we see that we see no picture anymore. The reason is already explained above.
				The foreground color needs to be made translucent using the <b>Opacity</b> slider. 100% corresponds to full coverage, 0% is completely
				transparent.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effect-foreground.png" width="768"/>
				
				<p>With only 10% opacity, there is now a slight haze over the image. The selected color foreground has an immediate effect on all
				individual images and is blended over the colors behind it.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effect-foreground-net.png" width="768"/>
				
				<p>Now a foreground image is added. It's located at <b>RunPNG/doc/samples/various/net orange.png</b>. Beach, beach ball, net seems
				to be a suitable combination. But you can see that the foreground image is too big. It has 512 x 512 pixels. Whoever likes it can leave
				it that way. The protruding parts are removed by the application when the images are put together.</p>

				<img class="hcenter" src="images/effect-foreground-net-sym.png" width="768"/>
				
				<p>Or you can scale the foreground image symmetrically with the button <img class="button-inline" src="../images/button-scale-sym.png" />.
				This would make the net finer-meshed.</p>
