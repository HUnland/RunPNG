				<p>The size of an APNG image sequence is the same for all individual images. Width and height are stored in a header data chunk like in a
				simple PNG file. Even if it may look different within an APNG file. But the user does not usually come into contact with this.</p> 

				<p class="contentsubtitle">Picture Sequence with Different Sizes</p>
				
				<p>In the folder <b>RunPNG/doc/samples/sectors 1/</b> there is a series of images (Frame #0.png - Frame #7.png) that we want to import.
				Six of these images have the dimensions 256 x 256 pixels. But two deviate from them.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/application-sectors1.png" width="768" />

				<p>At a first glance you can see that the pictures are not of the same size. If you hover the mouse pointer over frame #3, for example,
				the size 192 x 192 will be read there. It is too small for the purpose. The opposite is the case with frame #7 at 384 x 384 pixels. That's too big.
				In this case, RunPNG uses the yellow dashed frame to indicate the relative image size with which the application is currently working.</p>
				
				<p>We could of course save an animated sequence with the material as it is. However, RunPNG has to adhere to the common size. Frame #3
				would get a transparent filling around the outside and with frame #7 everything that protrudes would be cut off. Implicitly as if the
				user had cropped or filled images. Which might not be desirable in the rumbling result.</p>

				<p class="contentsubtitle">Common Sizes</p>
				
				<p>
					<img class="hcenter" src="images/tab-file-size1.png" width="340"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>But the given sizes are all not suitable. Because we want to save a small moving activity or waiting symbol with the dimensions 200 x 200 pixels.
				To do this, we enter the new width and height under the <b>PNG File</b> tab, select <b>Scale or pad images</b> and click on <b>Apply size</b>.
				Then all single images will get the same size.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/application-sectors2.png" width="768" />
				
				<p>Now we just have to tell the application under the <b>PNG File</b> tab that we want an animation. And under the tab <b>Single Frame</b> we set 100 ms.
				Don't forget to press <b>Delay for all frames.</b></p>
				
				<p><b>Note:</b> Sometimes not all of a series of images have the same aspect ratio. Or a different aspect ratio was entered under the <b>PNG File</b> tab.
				RunPNG scales and crops symmetrically and centered. If the aspect ratio is unsuitable, this can result in gaps on the outside.
				In that case the <b>... or pad images</b> means that they are then padded with transparency.</p>
