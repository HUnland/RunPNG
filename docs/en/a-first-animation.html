				<p class="contentsubtitle">Reading an Image Sequence</p>
			
				<p>Let's start with an already prepared image sequence and turn it into an animated PNG. The pictures for this are saved in the folder
				<b>RunPNG/doc/samples/sprockets 3/</b>.</p> 
				
				<div class="hcenter">
					<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="images/menu-file.png" width="300"/>
					<img src="../images/files-open.png" width="72"/><br clear="all" />
				</div>
								
				<p>First we start RunPNG. In the <b>File</b> menu, there is the <b>Open Image Series ...</b> entry. The corresponding button in the
				toolbar can also be used in the same way. If you click on one of the two, an open image series dialog appears.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/filechooser-open-files.png" width="550"/>
				
				<p>This dialog allows multiple selections. To load all 15 pictures, we first click on the picture at the top left and then with the shift key
				pressed on the picture at the bottom right. All images are now selected. Finally we click on <b>Open</b> and RunPNG loads the whole series
				of images into memory. </p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/application-sprockets.png" width="768" />
				
				<p>We now have a series of 15 images in the application's main memory. At first glance, there is hardly any difference between the individual images.
				But it is there. In the first picture, the gear is still straight. In the second it is rotated by only 2° clockwise, in the third by 4°, then by 6° etc.
				This results in a rotation of 28° in the last (15th) image. </p>
				
				<p>The reason: The gear shown has 12 teeth. 360° divided by 12 results in 30°. In the image sequence, the gear will only turn 28°. If the picture
				should appear for the 30° rotation, the display jumps back to picture #0 and the sequence starts again. This makes it appear as if the gear is
				rotating continuously. This saves a lot of work, storage space and possibly transmission times on the Internet. Because for a full rotation in 2° steps
				we would need 180 individual images. Which wouldn't make a lot of sense with the material at hand. </p>
				
				<p class="contentsubtitle">Setup the Animation</p>
			
				<p>
					<img class="hcenter" src="images/animated-loops.png" width="340"/>
				</p>
				
				<p>Next, the application needs to know what type of animation is to be used. There are three options for this: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Not animated</b> explains itself. With this setting, only the first single image would be saved as a simple PNG file.</li>
					<li><b>Animated</b> means, that all frames will be included in the animation loop.</li>
					<li><b>Animated, skip first frame</b> is intended for display programs that may not yet be able to display animated PNG files.
					Or maybe not supposed to. Only the first picture would then be shown there. Which could also contain a notice that animated PNG files
					are not supported.</li> 
				</ul>
				
				<p>The number of repetitions can be set right below. The number 0 means an endless repetition as long as the picture is shown. A higher number
				limits the repetitions to the entered value. The latter is intended for use cases in which a continuous repetition could prove to be disturbing.</p>

				<p>The other settings on this tab are explained later.</p>
				
				<p class="contentsubtitle">Setup the Delay Time</p>
				
				<p>
					<img class="hcenter" src="images/animated-delay.png" width="340"/>
				</p>

				<p>Under the tab "Single Frame" we come to the delay time of the single images. I. E. how long a picture is shown until the displaying program
				should switch to the next picture. A setting of 0 is possible and is also expressly accepted in the APNG standard. Which then means that the
				program should change the screen as quickly as possible.</p>

				<p>Said APNG standard provides for a fraction in seconds for the time specification: numerator / denominator. What could be 1/10 second but
				with 60/1 it can also last a minute. A minimum value of 1/1000 s and a maximum value of 65,535 / 1 s (&gt; 18 h) can be set here.
				RunPNG offers the input of milliseconds as a convenience function and converts the input into a fraction.</p>

				<p>The settings made here initially relate to the currently selected single image, so that individual values can be used. By clicking on
				the <b>Delay for all frames</b> button, the display time can also be transferred to all other images. Let's simply set a delay time of
				100 ms or 1/10 s for all images here. Or another value if desired.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="images/animated-series.png" width="530"/>
				
				<p>Then it looks something like this in the lower picture bar. The individual images now show the selected display or delay time.
				A little tip: If you hover the mouse pointer over a single image, a small window - called a tooltip - appears with information about the image.
				(Which is not so exciting here because all the pictures are the same size.) </p>

				<p class="contentsubtitle">Try the Animation</p>
			
				<p class="hcenter">
					<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="images/menu-player.png" width="133"/>
					<img src="../images/player-play.png" width="72"/><br clear="all" />
				</p>
				
				<p>You can now try out the new animation. To do this, click on the <b>Play</b> entry in the <b>Player</b> menu or on the above symbol in the toolbar.</p>
				
				<img class="hcenter" src="../images/player-pause.png" width="72"/>
				
				<p>To stop playback, click on the button above, which appears in the place of the <b>Play</b> button. </p>
				
				<p class="contentsubtitle">Save the Animation</p>
				
				<p class="hcenter">
					<img style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" src="images/menu-file-saveas.png" width="266"/>
					<img src="../images/file-saveas.png" width="72"/><br clear="all" />
				</p>
				
				<p>Finally the animation needs to be saved. Either via the <b>File</b> menu and the <b>Save as Picture ...</b> entry or via the button shown in the toolbar.</p>
				
				<p><b>Note:</b> RunPNG can save the images with the extension <b>.png</b> or <b>.apng</b>. According to the English Wikipedia, both are common filename
				extensions for APNG files. The German Wikipedia only specifies <b>.png</b> in a much poorer article. Mozilla itself does not comment on the filename
				extension and only announces the MIME type <b>image/apng</b> as an officially registered identifier with the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
				Windows 10 doesn't really know what to do with the ending <b>.apng</b>. Relevant graphics programs don't know the ending <b>.apng</b> anyway. It is
				therefore advisable to save the APNG files with the extension <b>.png</b>. Analogous to animated GIF files, which are usually not saved with the
				extension <b>.agif</b>.</p>
