				<p>What is RunPNG?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="contenttext">
				<p>RunPNG is an application for sequencing images in order to display them one after the other. Either as a kind of slide show or to show moving objects,
				like the rotating cubes at the end of this page. RunPNG uses the APNG format for this.</p>

				<p>Let's start with a little history. PNG - for <b>P</b>ortable <b>N</b>etwork <b>G</b>raphics - appeared on the digital world stage relatively late.
				In response to license claims that were raised for the patented Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm (LZW). Which i.a. in GIF file format is used for
				data compression. The first PNG specification came from Thomas Boutell and Tom Lane, which was later extended by Adam Costello and Glenn Randers-Pehrson.
				PNG uses the somewhat older - but patent-free - Lempel-Ziv algorithm (LZ78) for lossless data compression. Nonetheless, PNG is far superior to GIF format.
				While GIF is limited to indexed color palettes with a maximum of 256 colors including a single transparency, PNG can save in truecolor, greyscale and
				transparency channels. It also processes indexed color palettes by the way. Something like Holger Will's translucent cubes would be difficult or even
				impossible with GIF. Seen in this way, the license claims, about which we were so excited at the time, have long been recognized as a profit for all.
				And the patent protection for the LZW algorithm expired several years ago.</p>

				<p>For the PNG animation, Mozilla developers Stuart Parmenter and Vladimir Vukicevic defined the APNG file format based on the open PNG standard.
				In contrast to other approaches, the APNG format is backwards compatible with the PNG format. Which means that a neatly written simple PNG decoder
				should also be able to read the APNG format without any problems. The latter will skip the not understood blocks and be satisfied with the default picture.
				An APNG decoder, on the other hand, also understands the APNG blocks and only needs relatively few additional resources for this, since many algorithms are
				already available through the PNG definition. Most modern internet browsers now support the APNG file format.</p>

				<p>RunPNG has its own decoders and encoders. On the one hand, because the application goes beyond mere presentation. On the other hand, the Java runtime
				environment only offers reading and writing of simple PNG files. That is why the decoders and encoders have been reprogrammed from scratch. RunPNG can
				read existing APNG image sequences, decompress, decode and de-optimize them, as well as de-interlace the Adam7 format. And vice versa, save
				the whole thing again. The user can of course also use the software to generate new APNG files by putting together a sequence of individual images,
				cutting or scaling them if necessary, assigning a display time for them and saving the entire sequence as an image. A small player is available to
				test the animation.</p>

				<p>In addition, effects such as background, foreground or a mask can be added in RunPNG. The present version also has a simple image generator with
				which the user can "flow" an image in different directions.</p>
				
				<p>Last but not least, the original collections can be saved as a project together with all settings and additional images in order to resume work
				on them at a later point in time or to make changes afterwards. </p>

				<p>Now to the question of what RunPNG is not: RunPNG is not used for image editing. There are already powerful tools such as Gimp, Inkscape, PhotoshopÂ®,
				Paint.NET and many more. But who knows? Maybe someday.</p>
